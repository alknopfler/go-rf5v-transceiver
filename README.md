# Go transceiver interface for [RF-5V](https://sites.google.com/site/summerfuelrobots/arduino-sensor-tutorials/rf-wireless-transmitter-receiver-module-433mhz-for-arduino)


The goal of the project is to provide simple [burst packet transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame-bursting)

The [Manchester encoding](http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-9164-Manchester-Coding-Basics_Application-Note.pdf) is used to pass data through.
